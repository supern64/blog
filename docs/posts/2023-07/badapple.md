# Bad Apple on the micro:bit
If you're in the Touhou community, or really anything with a demoscene community, you've probably heard of this one black-and-white music video called "Bad Apple". It can basically be represented by anything resembling a screen, which is why people have gotten Bad Apple to run on [anything you could think of](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLajlU5EKJVdonUGTEc7B-0YqElDlz9Sf9).

But when people have gotten around to making Bad Apple run on so many devices, what's there left to run it on? A calculator? [Done.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pAeWf3NPNU) A fucking pregnancy test? [Done.](https://twitter.com/Foone/status/1302277329972948993)

After much thinking however, I thought about a slightly niche microcontroller device, called the micro:bit. I wouldn't have expected BBC to be the one who made this damn thing, but I guess it makes sense considering they also made the BBC Micro back in the 80s.
